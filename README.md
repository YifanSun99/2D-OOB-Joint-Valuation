# 2D-OOB

We provide an implementation of the paper "2D-OOB: Attributing Data Contribution through Joint Valuation Framework" as a part of Supplementary Material for anonymous review at ICML 2024. Please do not distribute files.

Refer to "Example.ipynb" (https://github.com/YifanSun99/df-oob/blob/main/Example.ipynb) as an easy-to-follow Jupyter notebook, which shows a toy example and a feature removal experiment using DF-OOB (and baseline methods).
